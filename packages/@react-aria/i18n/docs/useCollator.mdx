## Introduction

`useCollator` wraps a builtin browser [Intl.Collator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator)
object to provide a React Hook that integrates with the i18n system in React Aria. It handles string comparison according to the current locale,
updating when the locale changes, and caching of collators for performance. See the 
[Intl.Collator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator) docs for 
information.
