# aria-modal-polyfill

<p>{docs.exports.watchModals.description}</p>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['watchModals']} />

## Introduction

Certain browser + screen reader combinations do not implement aria-modal correctly, allowing users to navigate outside of the modal.
This watches a container for aria-modal nodes and hides the rest of the dom from screen readers when one is open use the [aria-hidden](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aria-hidden) package.

## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.watchModals} links={docs.links} />

## How to use
Include this once in your application at the top level before modals are rendered.
```
import {watchModals} from '@react-aria/aria-modal-polyfill';
watchModals();
```

You can also pass it a selector string, by default it will watch body, which is where most applications should have their provider.

```
watchModals('.my-modal-root');
```
