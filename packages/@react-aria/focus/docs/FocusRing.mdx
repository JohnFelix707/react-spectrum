## Introduction

`FocusRing` is a utility component that can be used to apply a CSS class when an element has keyboard focus.
This helps keyboard users determine which element on a page or in an application has keyboard focus as they
navigate around. Focus rings are only visible when interacting with a keyboard so as not to distract mouse
and touch screen users. When we are unable to detect if the user is using a mouse or touch screen, such as
switching in from a different tab, we show the focus ring.

If CSS classes are not being used for styling, see [useFocusRing](useFocusRing.html) for a hooks version.

## Props

<PropTable links={docs.links} component={docs.exports.FocusRing} />

## Example

This example shows how to use `<FocusRing>` to apply a CSS class when keyboard focus is on a button.

```css
.button {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
  background: green;
  border: none;
  color: white;
  font-size: 14px;
  padding: 4px 8px;
}
.button:disabled {
background: #6f6f6f;
}
.button.focus-ring {
  outline: 2px solid dodgerblue;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

.button + .button {
  margin-inline-start: 6px;
}
```

```tsx example
<FocusRing focusRingClass="focus-ring">
  <button className="button">Test</button>
</FocusRing>
```

### Disabled
When an interactive element is disabled, it should not show the focus ring and focus should be moved elsewhere.

```tsx example
function FocusSwitcher() {
    let [disableToggle, setDisableToggle] = React.useState(false);
    let [isFocusWithin, setFocusWithin] = React.useState(false);
    let {focusWithinProps} = useFocusWithin({
      onFocusWithinChange: isFocusWithin => setFocusWithin(isFocusWithin)
    })
    let btn1 = React.useRef();
    let btn2 = React.useRef();
    React.useEffect(() => {
      if (isFocusWithin) {
        disableToggle ? btn2.current.focus() : btn1.current.focus();
      }
    }, [disableToggle, isFocusWithin, btn1, btn2]);
    return (
      <div {...focusWithinProps}>
        <FocusRing isDisabled={disableToggle} focusRingClass="focus-ring">
          <button disabled={disableToggle} onClick={() => setDisableToggle(true)} ref={btn1} className="button">Test1</button>
        </FocusRing>
        <FocusRing isDisabled={!disableToggle} focusRingClass="focus-ring">
          <button disabled={!disableToggle} onClick={() => setDisableToggle(false)} ref={btn2} className="button">Test2</button>
        </FocusRing>
      </div>
    );
}
```
