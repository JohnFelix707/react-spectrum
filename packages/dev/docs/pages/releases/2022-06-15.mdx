# June 15, 2022 Release

 ðŸŽ‰ After a long wait, our date and time components and hooks have been released! Our DatePicker and Calendar packages support dates and times with configurable granularity in 13 different calendar systems used around the world! They are accessible, time zone aware, and touch friendly. They are also internationalized, supporting locale specific formatting, number systems, calendar systems, hour cycles, and right-to-left languages. You can find docs for the calendars, date and time fields, and range pickers below.

In addition to these components is a new library [`@internationalized`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/index.html), that provides locale-aware objects and functions for manipulating dates and times. This library supports time zone and calendar system aware arithmetic, locale-specific queries and conversions, and more in just 8 kB! Learn more about it in our [docs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html).

A special thanks to [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett) for his work on all things date and to our other contributors for this release ðŸ¤©

Enjoy!
