It is our last release of the year and we are happy to share a new TableView feature, now in beta. Using the new `allowsResizing` prop on a Column in TableView gives users the ability to dynamically adjust the width of that column. TableView column resizing supports mouse, keyboard, touch, and screen reader interactions to allow all users to take advantage of a customizable table. See the examples added to the [React Spectrum docs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/TableView.html#column-resizing) and try it for yourself.

In addition to this new feature, we have also made some performance improvements to TableView and ListView in React Spectrum, updated some of our types and fixed some accessibility issues related to focus. 

Thanks to all our contributors and happy holidays!!
