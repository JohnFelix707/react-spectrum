# November 08, 2023 Release

In this release, we’re promoting React Aria Components from beta to RC, introducing built-in support for form validation, adding a new Toolbar component, and fixing plenty of bugs.

Both React Aria and React Spectrum now have built-in support for form validation, including native HTML constraint validation, custom validation functions, realtime validation, and integration with server-side validation. Check out our [forms guide](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/forms.html) to learn more.

We also added [Toolbar](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Toolbar.html) to React Aria Components, which provides an accessible grouping that manages arrow key navigation between interactive elements such as buttons, dropdown menus, and checkboxes.

As always, huge thanks to everyone in our community for their feedback and contributions to make this release possible!

**React Aria Components API updates**
In this release, we made a few API final updates to React Aria Components.


1. ListBox, Menu, and GridList now have their own individual item components. The shared `<Item>` component has been removed and replaced with `<ListBoxItem>`, `<MenuItem>`, and `<GridListItem>`. Our default CSS classes have changed to match these names as well.
2. GridList and TagGroup have moved to using `display: contents` for their internal `gridcell` elements, making it easier to style items with flex or grid layout properties. If you were previously applying these using a descendant selector, you’ll need to move them to the parent row element.
3. The Dialog component now uses an explicit `<Heading slot=``"``title``"``>` to ensure that other headings in the dialog are not affected. You’ll need to add the `slot` prop to the main heading, and will see a console warning if no heading is provided.
