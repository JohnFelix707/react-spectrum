# October 06, 2023 Release

In this release, we are adding support of links in all collection components! 

In addition, React Spectrum has a new pre-released component, [DropZone](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/DropZone.html). 

More improvements and bug fixes have been made to [React Aria Components](../react-aria/react-aria-components.html) since its beta release. 

As always, huge thanks to all of our contributors for helping to make this release possible!
