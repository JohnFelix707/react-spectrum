# October 06, 2023 Release

In this release, we've extended support for links across all collection components! To streamline integration with client-side routers, we've introduced the `RouterProvider` component which will allow you to seamlessly incorproate client-site routers without the need to wrap a router Link component ([see docs]()). We have also continued to make improvements and bug fixes to [React Aria Components](../react-aria/react-aria-components.html) since its beta release. Internal contexts have been refactored to allow for greater customizability ([see docs](../react-aria/advanced.html)), MenuTrigger and DialogTrigger now use PressResponder to work with any pressable component, and updated documentation to help improve adoption. React Spectrum also has some new additons, including [DropZone](../react-spectrum/DropZone.html) and the [isPending](../react-spectrum/Button.html#pending) prop to Button. 

As always, huge thanks to everyone in our community for their feedback and contributions to make this release possible!
