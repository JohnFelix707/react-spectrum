# April 4, 2023 Release

In this release, we have many updates for our pre-release components including TagGroup and Table column resizing, both of which have reached RC status. Avatar has also moved to GA. We also included some API improvements to our existing React Aria hooks, fixed some SSR issues, improved overlay positioning, and fixed many other bugs.

We are also releasing the first alpha of [React Aria Components](../../react-aria/react-aria-components.html), a brand new component library built on top of our React Aria hooks! It provides a simpler way to build accessible components with custom styles, while offering the flexibility to drop down to hooks for even more customizability where needed. It includes a default DOM structure and styling API, and abstracts away all of the glue code necessary to connect the hooks together, allowing you to focus more on your unique design and styling. Check out the [documentation](../../react-aria/react-aria-components.html) to learn more, and read our [RFC](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/blob/main/rfcs/2023-react-aria-components.md) for even more details. While it is in alpha, we'd love for you to try it out and [give us feedback](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/issues) on the APIs so we can shape it into the best library it can be!
