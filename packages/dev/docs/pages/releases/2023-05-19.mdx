# May 19, 2023 Release

This month TagGroup and TableView column resizing and ActionBar are all being released to 3.0.0! We have also been making many improvements and bug fixes to the new [React Aria Components](../react-aria/react-aria-components.html) we announced last release. We have also added the much asked for Search to our docs. We hope this will aid in discoverability for our components and hooks.

As always, thanks to all of our contributors for helping to make this release possible! Special shoutout to [@auskast](https://github.com/auskast) for an extensive PR to help us improve our React Aria Components.

### TagGroup API update

This release of TagGroup includes a few API changes. If you were using a pre-release version please note you will need to update your code. See below for details.

**Spectrum**
* The `onRemove` callback prop now accepts a `Set<Key>` instead of a single Key. ** Add link to docs
* Removed `allowsRemoval` prop and instead infer this from `onRemove` being present or not.

**React Aria/Stately**
* The `onRemove` callback prop now accepts a `Set<Key>` instead of a single Key. ** Add link to docs
* Removed `allowsRemoval` prop and instead infer this from `onRemove` being present or not.
* Removed `labelProps` from  `useTag`.
* Users no longer need to pass `onRemove` from `useTagGroup` to `useTag`.
