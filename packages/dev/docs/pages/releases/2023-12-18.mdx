# December 18, 2023 Release

Welcome to the last release of the year! In this release, we‚Äôre promoting React Aria Components from RC to GA üéâ, promoting React Spectrum's Dropzone to RC, introducing a brand new StepList to React Spectrum, adding an option to optimize our included translation files, shipping a storybook based on all our React Aria Components with a starter theme, and fixing plenty of bugs.

As always, huge thanks to everyone in our community for their feedback and contributions to make this release and this year possible!

In a big year, there are a few accomplishments we wanted to highlight.
 - ESM support
 - React StrictMode support
 - React Aria Components
 - React Spectrum new components, Dropzone, InlineAlert, TagGroup, ActionBar, Avatar, Table Col Resizing
 - Docs Search
 - Built-in support for form validation
 - Native links support for collections
 - Tailwind plugin for RAC

As a parting holiday gift, check out our new landing page for React Aria Components, replete with interactive examples! /* INSERT LINK HERE */ Happy coding and see you in the new year! ‚òÉÔ∏è


### React Aria Components API updates

In this release, we made a few last API updates to React Aria Components as they move along to GA.

We had to temporarily remove nested column support in Tables due to some last minute use cases which we deemed to be inconsistent. We wouldn't have found these without all of your help using our components. Nested column support will be back, and should be easier to use in the future. Thanks for understanding.

/* Decide, do we mention removed onCellAction */
