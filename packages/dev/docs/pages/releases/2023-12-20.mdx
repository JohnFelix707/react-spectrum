# December 20, 2023 Release

Welcome to the last release of the year! In this release, we‚Äôre promoting React Aria Components from RC to GA üéâ, promoting React Spectrum's DropZone to RC, adding an option to optimize our included translation files, shipping a storybook based on all our React Aria Components with a starter theme, and fixing plenty of bugs.

As always, huge thanks to everyone in our community for their feedback and contributions to make this release and this year possible!

As a parting holiday gift, check out our new landing page for [React Aria Components](../react-aria/index.html), replete with interactive examples! Happy coding and see you in the new year! ‚òÉÔ∏è


### React Aria Components API updates

In this release, we made a few last API updates to React Aria Components as they move along to GA.

 - Temporarily removed nested column support in `Tables` due to instability.
 - Our `Collections` have come a long ways since we started RAC, please see the new page, [React Aria Collections](../react-aria/collections) for more information.
 - Hover and Focus are now distinct states in `ListBox`.
 - Hover state has been added to `Column Headers` in `Tables` when sorting is allowed.
 - All refs given to a component now go to their outer most element. If you need a ref to the input, you can attach it directly.
 - Styles for `Popover`, `Tooltip`, and `OverlayArrow` are now merged in a different order to allow overriding our default styles.
 - Added a dependency array to help manage the item cache with columns in `Tables`.

We've also added a new package and starter project to help people get started with RAC. The starter project can be found [on our getting started page](../react-aria/getting-started#starter-kit). And we have a new package with a starter theme as based on our docs examples `@react-aria/example-theme`.
