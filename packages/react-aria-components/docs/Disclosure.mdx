## Features

Custom styled disclosures can be difficult to build in an accessible way with the correct aria pattern. When implementing, you must manually ensure that the button and panel of content are semantically connected via ids for accessibility. `Disclosure` helps automate this, and hanle other accessibility features while allowing for custom styling.

* **Flexible** - Structured such that it can be used standalone or combined with other disclosures to form a `DisclosureGroup`
* **Accessible** - When focused, a disclosure's visibility can be toggled with either the <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard> or <Keyboard>Space</Keyboard> key, and the appropriate aria attributes are automatically applied.
* **Styleable** - Disable, keyboard focus, and selection states are provided for easy styling. These states only apply when interacting with an appropriate input device, unlike CSS pseudo classes.

## Anatomy

<Anatomy />

A disclosure consists of a button and panel of content. The button is wrapped in a heading element with the appropriate level based on the architecture of the page, and it contains the label representing the section of content that it controls the visibility for. The panel is the section of content that is associated with the button/header which is either expanded or collapsed.

```tsx
import {Button, UNSTABLE_Disclosure as Disclosure, UNSTABLE_DisclosurePanel as DisclosurePanel} from 'react-aria-components';

<Disclosure>
  <h3>
    <Button />
  </h3>
  <DisclosurePanel />
</Disclosure>

```

## Reusable wrappers

If you will use a Disclosure in multiple places in your app, you can wrap all of the pieces into a reusable component. This way, the DOM structure, styling code, and other logic are defined in a single place and reused everywhere to ensure consistency.

This example wraps `Disclosure` and all of its children together into a single component.

```tsx example export=true

import type {DisclosureProps} from 'react-aria-components';

interface MyDisclosureProps extends Omit<DisclosureProps, 'children'> {
  label?: string,
  content?: string
}

function MyDisclosure({label, content, ...props}: MyDisclosureProps) {
  return (
    <Disclosure {...props}>
      <h3>
        <Button slot="trigger">
          <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
            <path d="m8.25 4.5 7.5 7.5-7.5 7.5" />
          </svg>
          {label}
        </Button>
      </h3>
      <DisclosurePanel>
        <p>{content}</p>
      </DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

<MyDisclosure label="Manage your account" content="How to manage your account" />
```

## Expanded

An uncontrolled Disclosure can be expanded by default using the `defaultExpanded` prop.

```tsx example
<MyDisclosure label="Download, Install, and Set Up" content="Instructions on how to download, install, and set up" defaultExpanded />
```

A controlled Disclosure can be expanded and collapsed using `isExpanded` and `onExpandedChange`

```tsx example
function ControlledExpanded() {
  let [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = React.useState(true);

  return (
    <MyDisclosure label="Download, Install, and Set Up" content="Instructions on how to download, install, and set up" isExpanded={isExpanded} onExpandedChange={setIsExpanded} />
  )
}

<ControlledExpanded />

```

## Disabled

A Disclosure can be disabled using the `isDisabled` prop. 

```tsx example
<MyDisclosure label="Introduction to Knitting" content="Details about knitting here" isDisabled />
```

## Props

### Disclosure

<PropTable component={docs.exports.UNSTABLE_Disclosure} links={docs.links} />

### Button

<details>
  <summary style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}><ChevronRight size="S" /> Show props</summary>

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Button} links={docs.links} />

</details>

### DisclosurePanel

<details>
  <summary style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}><ChevronRight size="S" /> Show props</summary>

<PropTable component={docs.exports.UNSTABLE_DisclosurePanel} links={docs.links} />

</details>

## Styling

React Aria components can be styled in many ways, including using CSS classes, inline styles, utility classes (e.g. Tailwind), CSS-in-JS (e.g. Styled Components), etc. By default, all components include a builtin `className` attribute which can be targeted using CSS selectors. These follow the `react-aria-ComponentName` naming convention.

```css
.react-aria-Disclosure {
  /* ... */
}
```

A custom `className` can also be specified on any component. This overrides the default `className` provided by React Aria with your own.

```jsx
<Disclosure className="my-disclosure">
  {/* ... */}
</Disclosure>
```

In addition, some components support multiple UI states (e.g. focused, placeholder, readonly, etc.). React Aria components expose states using data attributes, which you can target in CSS selectors. For example:

```css
.react-aria-Disclosure[data-expanded] {
  /* ... */
}
```

The `className` and `style` props also accept functions which receive states for styling. This lets you dynamically determine the classes or styles to apply, which is useful when using utility CSS libraries like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

```jsx
<Disclosure className={({isExpanded}) => isExpanded ? 'border-blue-500' : 'border-gray-600'} />
```

The states, selectors, and render props for each component used in a `Disclosure` are documented below.

### Disclosure

A `Disclosure` can be targeted with the `.react-aria-Disclosure` CSS selector, or by overriding with a custom `className`. It supports the following states:

<StateTable properties={docs.exports.DisclosureRenderProps.properties} />

### Button

A `Button` can be targeted with the `.react-aria-Button` CSS selector, or by overriding with a custom `className`. It supports the following states:

<StateTable properties={docs.exports.ButtonRenderProps.properties} />

### DisclosurePanel

A `DisclosurePanel` can be targeted with the `.react-aria-DisclosurePanel` CSS selector, or by overriding with a custom `className`.

## Advanced Customization

### Contexts

All React Aria Components export a corresponding context that can be used to send props to them from a parent element. This enables you to build your own compositional APIs similar to those found in React Aria Components itself. You can send any prop or ref via context that you could pass to the corresponding component. The local props and ref on the component are merged with the ones passed via context, with the local props taking precedence (following the rules documented in [mergeProps](mergeProps.html)).

<ContextTable components={['UNSTABLE_Disclosure']} docs={docs} />

This example shows a `DisclosureGroup` component that renders a group of disclosures. The entire group can be marked as disabled via the `isDisabled` prop, which is passed to all child disclosures via the `UNSTABLE_DisclosureContext` provider.

```tsx example
import {DisclosureContext} from 'react-aria-components';

interface DisclosureGroupProps {
  children?: React.ReactNode,
  isDisabled?: boolean
}

function DisclosureGroup({children, isDisabled}: DisclosureGroupProps) {
  return (
    <div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column'}}>
      <DisclosureContext.Provider value={{isDisabled}}>
        {children}
      </DisclosureContext.Provider>
    </div>
  )
}

<DisclosureGroup isDisabled>
    <MyDisclosure label="How to make a return" content="Details about returning items" />
    <MyDisclosure label="How to cancel an order" content="Details on canceling an order" />
</DisclosureGroup>

```

### State

DisclosureGroup provides a <TypeLink links={statelyDocs.links} type={statelyDocs.exports.DisclosureState} /> object to its children via `DisclosureStateContext`. This can be used to access and manipulate the disclosure group's state.

### Hooks

If you need to customize things further, such as accessing internal state or customizing DOM structure, you can drop down to the lower level Hook-based API. See useDisclosure.
