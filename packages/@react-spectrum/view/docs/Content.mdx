<p>{docs.exports.Content.description}</p>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Content']} />

## Examples

```tsx example
<Content>Try another search</Content>
```

## Content

The Content component is used as a child to other
components providing formatting and semantic meaning as explained in
[Dialog](Dialog.html#content). It is
important to note that the Content element
accepts any renderable node, not just strings.

A Content is used to specify the content of a component. Examples of usage
[Dialog](Dialog.html#example) and [IllustratedMessage](IllustratedMessage.html#example).

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Content} links={docs.links} />
