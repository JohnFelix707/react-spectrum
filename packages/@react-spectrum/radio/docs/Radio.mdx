  <Radio value="dogs">
    Dogs
  </Radio>
  <Radio value="cats">
    Cats
  </Radio>
</RadioGroup>

## Content

Radio Buttons can have a visible label, although they are not required to have one.
All radio components, even if there is only one, cannot be rendered outside of a Radio Group.

## Labeling

A Radio must have a label to be properly identified to users of assistive technology.
The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is by adding a label prop to the Radio Group.
If the label prop is null and therefore no visible label will be shown, then include the label as a prop of type string to the Radio Group.

// Props
{label: null, 'aria-label': 'Favorite food'}

<RadioGroup {...props}>
  <Radio value="wizard">
    Wizard
  </Radio>
  <Radio value="dragon">
    Dragon
  </Radio>
</RadioGroup>

## Events

Event handlers for change can be registered as shown below.

<RadioGroup aria-label="Favorite avatar" onChange={e => alert('Radio Button clicked!')}>
  <Radio value="wizard">
    Wizard
  </Radio>
  <Radio value="dragon">
    Dragon
  </Radio>
</RadioGroup>

### Accessibility

Radios are accessible by default, rendered in HTML using the <input type="radio"> element.
When the radio is checked, the appropriate ARIA state attribute will automatically be applied.

### Internationalization

To internationalize a radio button, a localized string should be passed to the label prop of the Radio Button.
For languages that are read right to left, Hebrew and Arabic for example, the radio is placed on the right side of the text.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Radio} links={docs.links} />

## Visual Options

Radio Buttons have a number of props for controlling their visual / checked state.

## Orientation

{orientation: 'horizontal'}

The default orientation is to be aligned vertically.
An optional prop can be passed to the Radio Group to position the Radio Buttons inline

## Label Position

{labelPosition: 'side'}

The default position of a label is on top of the Radio Buttons.
An optional prop can be passed to the Radio Group that will position the label to the left on the topmost Radio Button.
If the position is set to horizontal as well then the label will be directly to the left of the leftmost Radio Button.

## Label Align

{labelAlign: 'end'}

The default top position for a label is left aligned.
A label can be right aligned via an optional prop to the Radio Group.

## Disabled

{isDisabled: true}

The disabled prop applies a disabled style to the Radio Button, and also prevents clicks from selecting it as an option.

## Ready Only

{isReadOnly: true}

In this mode no visual indication is given to the user that any option within the Radio Group has been selected.

## Emphasized

{isEmphasized: true}

By default, radio buttons are not emphasized (gray filling).
The emphasized version is a blue filling that provides a visual prominence.

## InValid

{validationState: 'invalid'}

The label text and the Radio circle itself are both red.

## Auto Focus

{autoFocus: true}

A visual blue ring can be put around a specific option within the radio group.

## Default Checked

{defaultValue: 'dragons'}

A group of Radio Buttons can be rendered with an option already selected.
The Radio option that is checked by default can be picked by passing in this prop where the string value
matches the value prop passed to the Radio Button.
This does not impact any other behavior for the user.
