# SearchWithin

<p>{docs.exports.SearchWithin.description}</p>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['SearchWithin']}
  sourceData={[
    {type: 'Spectrum', url: 'https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/button/'}
  ]} />

## Example

```tsx example
<SearchWithin label="Search">
  <SearchField placeholder="Search" />
  <Picker defaultSelectedKey="all">
    <Item key="all">All</Item>
    <Item key="campaigns">Campaigns</Item>
    <Item key="audiences">Audiences</Item>
    <Item key="tags">Tags</Item>
  </Picker>
</SearchWithin>
```

## Content

SearchWithin accepts a [Search Field](SearchField.html) and a [Picker](SearchField.html) as children.

## Labeling

SearchWithin can be labeled using the `label` prop. This will add a visible label, and be used by the SearchField and the Picker's aria-labelledby, as well as by the group itself.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.SearchWithin} links={docs.links} />
