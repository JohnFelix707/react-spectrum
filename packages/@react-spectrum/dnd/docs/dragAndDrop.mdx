# Drag and Drop

This page describes how to enable drag and drop functionality for the various React Spectrum components that support it.

## Introduction

Drag and drop is an operation performed when a user "grabs" a UI element via their pointing device and drops it on a different location or element.
It has become a common interaction in many modern applications due to its flexibility across a variety of use cases but can come saddled with
many accessibility issues, including but not limited to keyboard interaction parity and difficulties mimicking drag operations with mouse emulators.
React Spectrum collection components that support drag and drop operations seek to address these issues by providing full keyboard and screen reader drag and drop
support.

To perform a drag and drop operations via a keyboard, first select the items to be dragged. You can then start the drag operation by focusing the drag handle on any of the
selected rows and hitting <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard>/<Keyboard>Space</Keyboard>. Once a drag operation is started, <Keyboard>Tab</Keyboard> can be used to cycle through valid
drop targets. Hitting <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard> will then confirm the drop operation on the focused drop target. For screen readers, please follow the instructions announced
when focusing the row's drag handle to begin a drag operation. Go ahead and try out drag and drop in the example below!


## Drag and Drop Concepts

TODO: add stuff from RFC

## Example

```tsx example
import {Flex} from '@react-spectrum/layout';

<Flex gap="size-300">
  <DraggableList />
  <DroppableList />
</Flex>
```

### Creating the draggable list

The example above illustrates how one would use `useDragHooks` and `useDropHooks` to enable dragging files from one ListView to another. For the first ListView, we want
to make the rows draggable and have the dragged rows removed from the list upon a successful drop. To accomplish this, we first want to setup the initial list of items for
our draggable ListView via [useListData](/react-stately/useListData.html) so that we have access to some helper methods to modify the list of items on the fly.

```tsx example render=false
let list = useListData({
  initialItems: items || [
    {id: 'a', textValue: 'Adobe Photoshop', type: 'file'},
    {id: 'b', textValue: 'Adobe XD', type: 'file'},
    {id: 'c', textValue: 'Adobe Dreamweaver', type: 'file'},
    {id: 'd', textValue: 'Adobe InDesign', type: 'file'},
    {id: 'e', textValue: 'Adobe Connect', type: 'file'}
  ]
});
```

Next, we need to specify the data associated with each dragged item via the array returned by `getItems`. In this case, we look up the information for each dragged item and
serialize it, mapping it to the items type. This information will be processed and provided to the drop target's drop handlers on drop.

```tsx example render=false
function getItems(keys) {
  return [...keys].map(key => {
    let item = list.getItem(key);
    return {
      [item.type]: JSON.stringify(item)
    };
  })
}
```

We also create a `onDragEnd` event handler for `useDragHooks` that handles removing the dragged items from the draggable list upon a successful drop operation. Note how we use
the `.remove` method provided by `useListData` to remove the dropped items from our list.

```tsx example render=false
function onDragEnd(e) {
  if (e.dropOperation === 'move') {
    list.remove(...e.keys);
  }
}
```

Finally, we simply provide our `getItems` and `onDragEnd` functions as options to `useDragHooks`, providing us with a set of `dragHooks` that we can pass to our ListView directly.
Below is what our draggable ListView would look like after combining everything together. For more info on `getItems` and `onDragEnd`, see the [API section](#api) below.

```tsx example export=true render=false
import {Item, ListView} from '@react-spectrum/list';
import {useDragHooks} from '@react-spectrum/dnd';
import {useListData} from '@react-stately/data';

function DraggableList(props) {
  let {
    items,
    ...otherProps
  } = props;
  let list = useListData({
    initialItems: items || [
      {id: 'a', textValue: 'Adobe Photoshop', type: 'file'},
      {id: 'b', textValue: 'Adobe XD', type: 'file'},
      {id: 'c', textValue: 'Adobe Dreamweaver', type: 'file'},
      {id: 'd', textValue: 'Adobe InDesign', type: 'file'},
      {id: 'e', textValue: 'Adobe Connect', type: 'file'}
    ]
  });

  let dragHooks = useDragHooks({
    getItems: (keys) => [...keys].map(key => {
      let item = list.getItem(key);
      return {
        [item.type]: JSON.stringify(item)
      };
    }),
    onDragEnd: (e) => {
      if (e.dropOperation === 'move') {
        list.remove(...e.keys);
      }
    }
  });

  return (
    <ListView
      aria-label="Draggable list view example"
      width="size-3600"
      height="size-3600"
      selectionMode="multiple"
      items={list.items}
      dragHooks={dragHooks}
      {...otherProps}>
      {item => (
        <Item key={item.key}>
          {item.textValue}
        </Item>
      )}
    </ListView>
  );
}
```

### Creating the droppable list

For the second ListView, we want to make it droppable but have it only accept root level drops. Similar to the draggable ListView, we'll start by initializing the default item list
via [useListData](/react-stately/useListData.html).

```tsx example render=false
let list = useListData({
  initialItems: items || [
    {id: 'f', textValue: 'Adobe AfterEffects', type: 'file'},
    {id: 'g', textValue: 'Adobe Illustrator', type: 'file'},
    {id: 'h', textValue: 'Adobe Lightroom', type: 'file'},
    {id: 'i', textValue: 'Adobe Premiere Pro', type: 'file'},
    {id: 'j', textValue: 'Adobe Fresco', type: 'file'}
  ]
});
```

To implement root level only drops, we create a `getDropOperation` function that returns `"cancel"` for any drop target other than `root` and if the dragged item types doesn't include
`'file'`.

```tsx example render=false
function getDropOperation(target, types) {
  if (target.type !== 'root' || !types.has('file')) {
    return 'cancel';
  }

  return 'move';
}
```

Next, we create a `onDrop` event handler to process the successfully dropped items. This `onDrop` handler first checks each dropped item's kind and type, extracting the item's
relevant information if it detects it has the expected types. This information is used to construct an array of items to add to the list and then inserting them to the end of the
droppable list.

```tsx example render=false
async function onDrop(e) {
  let itemsToAdd = [];
  for (let item of e.items) {
    if (item.kind === 'text' && item.types.has('file')) {
      let {type, id, textValue} = JSON.parse(await item.getText('file'));
      if (!!type && !!id && !!textValue) {
        itemsToAdd.push({
          id,
          type,
          textValue
        });
      }
    }
  }
  list.append(...itemsToAdd);
}
```

Finally, we simply provide our `getDropOperation` and `onDrop` functions as options to `useDropHooks`, providing us with a set of `dropHooks` that we can pass to our ListView directly.
Below is what our droppable ListView would look like after combining everything together. For more info on `getDropOperation` and `onDrop`, see the [API section](#api) below.

```tsx example export=true render=false
import {useDropHooks} from '@react-spectrum/dnd';

function DroppableList(props) {
  let {
    items,
    ...otherProps
  } = props;
  let list = useListData({
    initialItems: items || [
      {id: 'f', textValue: 'Adobe AfterEffects', type: 'file'},
      {id: 'g', textValue: 'Adobe Illustrator', type: 'file'},
      {id: 'h', textValue: 'Adobe Lightroom', type: 'file'},
      {id: 'i', textValue: 'Adobe Premiere Pro', type: 'file'},
      {id: 'j', textValue: 'Adobe Fresco', type: 'file'}
    ]
  });

  let dropHooks = useDropHooks({
    getDropOperation: (target, types) => {
      if (target.type !== 'root' || !types.has('file')) {
        return 'cancel';
      }

      return 'move';
    },
    onDrop: async (e) => {
      let itemsToAdd = [];
      for (let item of e.items) {
        if (item.kind === 'text' && item.types.has('file')) {
          let {type, id, textValue} = JSON.parse(await item.getText('file'));
          if (!!type && !!id && !!textValue) {
            itemsToAdd.push({
              id,
              type,
              textValue
            });
          }
        }
      }
      list.append(...itemsToAdd);
    }
  });

  return (
    <ListView
      aria-label="Droppable list view example"
      width="size-3600"
      height="size-3600"
      selectionMode="multiple"
      items={list.items}
      dropHooks={dropHooks}
      {...otherProps}>
      {item => (
        <Item key={item.key}>
          {item.textValue}
        </Item>
      )}
    </ListView>
  );
}
```

As seen in the [example](#example) above, enabling drag and drop for a supported React Spectrum component differs slightly from the typical event handler prop pattern that you may be familiar with.
Instead of providing each event handler directly to the component, you must first import `useDragHooks` and `useDropHooks` from the `@react-spectrum/dnd` package
and provide those hooks with your desired options.

`useDragHooks` will then provide you with a set of drag hooks that you can pass to the component via its `dragHooks` prop, thus enabling drag operations for the component.
Drop operations can be enabled in the same way by passing the hooks from `useDropHooks` to the component's `dropHooks` prop.

Of the various hook options above, `getAllowedDropOperations` and `getDropOperation` may be of particular interest since it allows you to specify what kinds of drag and drop operations you want to allow.
When the dragged items are dropped on a drop target created using the React Aria drag and drop hooks, the allowed drop operations you return in `getAllowedDropOperations`
are provided to the drop target's `getDropOperation`, giving the drop target extra information which it can use to decide what drop operation to execute. This in turn provides
the `onDragEnd` and `onDrop` handlers with the executed drop operation, allowing you to decide what to do with the dragged items in your original collection and in the dropped collection.

For instance, you may have a draggable collection of items that allows `move` and `copy` operations but you need a way to know whether or not you should be removing the dragged items
from the list after a drop operation. A drop target that only allows `copy` operations, such as a file upload drop zone, would be able to return `copy` from its `getDropOperation` and communicate that
to your draggable collection's `onDragEnd` handler, letting it know that it shouldn't remove the dragged items from the list. Alternatively, a drop target that allows `move` operations, like in the
[example](#example) above, would return `move` from its `getDropOperation` and thus inform your draggable collection to remove the dragged items from it list.

You may be wondering why we didn't simply import the drag and drop hooks within the components themselves. The reason behind this is to reduce the bundle size of
the component for users who don't need the drag and drop support for their component.

## Supported components
