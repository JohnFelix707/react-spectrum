import {Layout} from '@react-spectrum/docs';
export default Layout;

import docs from 'docs:@react-spectrum/well';
import {HeaderInfo, PropTable} from '@react-spectrum/docs';
import packageData from '../package.json';

```jsx import
import {Well} from '@react-spectrum/well';
```

# Well

<p>{docs.exports.Well.description}</p>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Well']}
  sourceData={[]} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Well>Better a little which is well done, than a great deal imperfectly.</Well>
```

## Content

Wells can have children. They can be nested.

```tsx example
<Well>Well</Well>

<Well>Well <Well>oh well.</Well></Well>
```

### Internationalization

In order to internationalize a well, a localized string should be passed to the `children` prop.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Well} links={docs.links} />
