## Content

The Image component is used as a child to other components providing formatting
and semantic meaning.

An Image is used to add images to components. Example of usage [Dialog](Dialog.html#examples).

See [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) for more information.

Note: An image must either have the `decorative` prop or have the `alt` prop set.

### Internationalization

To internationalize an Image, a localized string should be passed to the `alt` prop.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Image} links={docs.links} />

## Visual Options

### Decorative

```tsx example
<Image src="https://i.imgur.com/Z7AzH2c.png" decorative />
```

### Object Fit

```tsx example
<Image src="https://i.imgur.com/Z7AzH2c.png" alt="Sky and roof" objectFit="cover" />
```
