## Content

*If the component has a children prop that accepts any type of content (e.g. `ReactNode`), include this section. Please include a note about how to internationalize the content.*

Discuss slots and put the grid displaying what slots Dialog supports here

accessibility stuff about children order goes here

same thing about autofocus for the children

### Internationalization REMOVE THIS FOR DIALOG?

*If this component has content, cover how to internationalize the content, include this section.*

## Value REMOVE THIS FOR DIALOG

*If the component displays or allows a user to input a value, include this section.*

## Labeling

*If the component supports a label prop, include this section. Please include a note about how to internationalize the content.*

Accessibility stuff concerning the header aria-labelledby stuff goes here. Maybe this goes into content?


## Events

*If the component supports event props, include this section. Only cover the events that are important to the main functionality of the component.*

Close as a function goes here, put how to chain this with their own close callback
Press events?
Do I put isDismissible here (does it mean you don't have to do the close as a function)

Maybe isDismissable becomes its own section? Maybe place it in Visual Options? Maybe it becomes a section here?
isDismissable is technically a DialogTrigger prop so don't go into too much detail here? Just mention how if affect close behavior
and hides the Footer slot. Actually 



## Validation REMOVE THIS FOR DIALOG

*If the component supports validation props, include this section.*

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Dialog} links={docs.links} />

## Visual Options

*Show examples of all variants and visual props here with links to the design website for more usage details. Examples can be grouped together for conciseness.*

Talk about types here. Put a note that this is set by the context/dialog trigger
