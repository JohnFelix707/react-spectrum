<br />

Spectrum workflow icons are graphical metaphors or symbols that users interact with to navigate and manipulate objects.
They all appear at the same size within each platform, 18 px for desktop and 22 px for mobile. See [ActionButton](/react-spectrum/ActionButton.html#content)
and [Picker](/react-spectrum/Picker.html#complex-items) for some examples of icon usage within React Spectrum components.

See the table below for a full list of available workflow icons.

```tsx snippet
<IconTable iconPackage="workflow" />
```
