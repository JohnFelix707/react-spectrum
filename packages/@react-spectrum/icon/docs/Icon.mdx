## Available Icons

Spectrum workflow icons are graphical metaphors or symbols that users interact with to navigate and manipulate objects.
They all appear at the same size within each platform, 18 px for desktop and 22 px for mobile. See [ActionButton](/react-spectrum/ActionButton.html#content)
and [Picker](/react-spectrum/Picker.html#complex-items) for some examples of icon usage within React Spectrum components.

See the table below for a full list of available workflow icons. Note that you are free to rename the imports, meaning the following
two are equivalent:

```tsx
import Add from '@spectrum-icons/workflow/Add';
import IconAdd from '@spectrum-icons/workflow/Add';
```

```tsx snippet
<IconTable iconPackage="workflow" />
```
