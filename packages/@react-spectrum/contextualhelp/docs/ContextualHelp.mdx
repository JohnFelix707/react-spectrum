# Contextual Help

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.ContextualHelp.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['ContextualHelp']}
  sourceData={[]} />

## Example

```tsx example
<ContextualHelp variant="info">
  <Heading>Need help?</Heading>
  <Content><Text>If you're having issues accessing your account, contact our customer support team for help.</Text></Content>
</ContextualHelp>
```

## Content

Unlike [Dialog](Dialog.html), the layout in ContextualHelp is very deliberate. Every ContextualHelp component is triggered as a popover where the
trigger element is a quiet action button with either a help or info icon. Much like [Dialog](Dialog.html), however, ContextualHelp has sections that
can be populated by providing the following components to your ContextualHelp as children:
[Heading](Heading.html) (title), [Content](Content.html) (body), and [Footer](Footer.html) (link).
Each of these components are required in a Spectrum compliant ContextualHelp except for `Footer` since including a link is optional.

## Events

ContextualHelp accepts an `onOpenChange` prop, triggered when the ContextualHelp's popover opens or closes.

The example below uses `onOpenChange` to tell the user when the ContextualHelp popover opened or closed.

```tsx example
function Example() {
  let onOpenChange = () => alert('Popover open changed.');

  return (
    <ContextualHelp variant="info" onOpenChange={onOpenChange}>
      <Heading>Permission required</Heading>
      <Content><Text>Your admin must grant you permission before you can create a segment.</Text></Content>
    </ContextualHelp>
  );
}
```

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.ContextualHelp} links={docs.links} />

## Visual options

### Variant

#### Info

Use the info icon for brief, specific, contextual guidance. This is best for supplemental or nice-to-know information,
in-line with a label or a component (if there is no label). The content for an info iconâ€™s popover should be [instructive](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/voice-and-tone/#Tone-spectrum) in tone.

```tsx example
<ContextualHelp variant="info">
  <Heading>Permission required</Heading>
  <Content><Text>Your admin must grant you permission before you can create a segment.</Text></Content>
</ContextualHelp>
```

#### Help

Use the help icon for content that offers more detailed, in-depth guidance about a task, UI element, tool, or keyboard shortcuts.
This may include an image, video, or link and should be [helpful](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/voice-and-tone/#Tone-spectrum) in tone.

```tsx example
<ContextualHelp variant="help">
  <Heading>What is a segment?</Heading>
  <Content><Text>Segments identify who your visitors are, what devices and services they use, where they navigated from, and much more.</Text></Content>
  <Footer><Link>Learn more about segments</Link></Footer>
</ContextualHelp>
```
