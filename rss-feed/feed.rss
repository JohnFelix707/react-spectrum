        <![CDATA[Welcome to the first release of the new year! We have had a great response to our GA release of React Aria Components. If you haven’t tried it out, visit our docs to explore the examples. To help get you started, we have also created a few starter kits. These downloadable starter kits contain beautifully styled implementations of every available component and includes a working storybook. Available in vanilla and Tailwind CSS. We have been busy working on our new Submenu feature which we are excited to release as an alpha. We have also made improvements to our overlay positioning code to better handle pinch zooming and spatial awareness.]]>
