# Release Notes

## v0.5.0

This version includes a major update to the way Dialogs are created. Previously, the Dialog API largely followed S1's Dialog's API
where the DialogTrigger was responsible for rendering both modal and popover type dialogs. However, this limited the ability for end users
to fully customize the internal layout and contents of their dialogs. To support this use case, S2 Dialog has been split into four components:
* [Dialog](?path=/docs/dialog--docs) - Only renders modal dialogs and comes with the standard layout previously supported (hero image, heading, content, etc).
* [FullscreenDialog](?path=/docs/fullscreendialog--docs) - Render a fullscreen or takeover modal. Has the standard padding built in but this can be removed to allow for edge-to-edge content.
* [CustomDialog](?path=/docs/customdialog--docs) - Supports completely custom dialog layouts. Also supports the standard padding by default or edge-to-edge content.
* [Popover](?path=/docs/popover--docs) - Only way to create popover dialogs now. The layout of its contents can be freely customized but always has 8px of padding.

Note that many of the props that previously existed on DialogTrigger and DialogContainer (e.g. `isKeyboardDismissDisabled`, `placement`, etc) have now been shifted to the dialogs now as a part of this change.

* The `style` macro will now error if it is called without importing `with {type: 'macro'}`. Previously it would fail to apply styles silently. This should help with debugging.
